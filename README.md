# Boston Housing Regression Project
Overview:
This project is a basic example of a machine learning regression task using the Boston Housing dataset. The goal is to predict the median value of owner-occupied homes (MEDV) based on various features.

## Dependencies:

* NumPy
  
* pandas
  
* scikit-learn

## Usage:
1. Clone the repository
   
Run the Jupyter Notebook boston_housing_regression.ipynb to go through the entire machine learning pipeline, from loading the dataset to training and evaluating the linear regression model.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SuryakiranR/Linear-Regression-on-Boston-Housing.git
cd Linear-Regression-on-Boston-Housing
```
2. Install Dependencies

```bash

pip install -r requirements.txt

```

## Model Evaluation 

The model's performance is evaluated using the root mean squared error (RMSE) on both the training and testing sets.

```bash
the model performance for training set
RMSE is 4.710901797319796

the model performance for testing set
RMSE is 4.687543527902972
```
